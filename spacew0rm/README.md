## SPACEW0RM

Spacew0rm is a simple DL-Pascal demo of a game for the Casio PB-2000C. It is somewhat reminiscent of a classic game featuring a scaly, legless reptile that gets longer when it eats, but it's totally not it!

(imagine a flashy 1980s video game cover bearing no resemblance to the actual game whatsoever)

The year is 2399 and humanity has pioneered space travel using chains of wormholes to discover new worlds. Wormholes however may lead to dangerous areas, full of debris and other unknowns (mostly debris as it turns out).

And so, SPACEW0RM was born. SPACEW0RM is a vessel designed to clear the wormhole destinations and make them safe for future incoming crews. It does so by collecting debris and attaching it to itself, which then disintegrates when SPACEW0RM travels through the next wormhole.

In this game, YOU take control of SPACEW0RM. Clear levels to find the next wormhole and help Make Space OK-ish Again!

## How / Why?

I wrote this during COVID lockdown as a quick weekend afternoon project, just to try out DL-Pascal. It's intentionally written in 100% Pascal with no ASM code to show how quick and responsive it can be. Graphics routines used are very naive, but there is music, sound effects and the game progresses across ten levels, with increasing speed and maximum length of SPACEW0RM. Otherwise everything is pretty vanilla with no custom fonts. The game can be won to show a winning screen and music, but on the final level the vessel reaches 100% of screen length...

## What is DL-Pascal and what is Casio PB-2000C?

Are you lost? Perhaps you have reached the end of the Internet; turn around when possible.
